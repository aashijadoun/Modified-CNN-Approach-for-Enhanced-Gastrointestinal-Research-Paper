Modified CNN Approach for Enhanced Gastrointestinal Tract Classification RESEARCH PAPER
The paper provides an assessment of how the Kvasir dataset performs concerning GI disorder identification and classification by computer algorithms applied as training. It assesses how suitable this kind of dataset would be to help the machine learning and deep learning algorithms classify most GI pathologies-such as polyps, ulcers, or inflammatory signs. It also investigates whether it might also make the model generalize better for different GI conditions, enhance diagnostic reliability further, and help in further developing real-time, computer-assisted diagnostic tools that can benefit clinicians for early detection and treatment strategies.
